# 🧺 smart laundry expert

Expert system for domestic laundry care management with dynamically capturing user inputs asserted as facts. This system generates recommendations on wash mode, detergent type, drying method and temparature along with additional recommandations, which are inferred from rules based on conditional logic. The conceptual basis includes factors such as fabric care level, washing intensity and other factors.

This project illustrates key Artificial Intelligence concepts such as:
- Rule-based reasoning  
- Knowledge representation  
- Logical inference using **Prolog*

## ✨ Features

- Knowledge base of fabrics, stains, weather and wash conditions  
- Dynamic rules for fabric care and detergent selection  
- Query-based expert recommendations  
- Easily extensible rule system  
- Educational example of an AI expert system in Prolog  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** SWI-Prolog  
- **Pengines:** Prolog Engines for user interface
- **Concepts:** Facts, Rules, Logical Inference

## ✨ User Inputs for Recommendations

- Type of fabric 
- Level of dirtiness  
- Color category of fabric
- Load size 
- Whether stains are present
- Current weather conditions
- Urgency of the laundry
- Type of water (soft/hard)

---

## ✨ Recommendations Generated

- Washing Intensity 
- Temperature Selection  
- Detergent Recommendation
- Drying Method 
- Wash Mode
- Additional Recommendations
