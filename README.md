# smart_laundry_expert

Expert system for domestic laundry care management with dynamically capturing user inputs asserted as facts. This system generates recommendations on wash mode, detergent type, drying method and temparature along with additional recommandations, which are inferred from rules based on conditional logic. The conceptual basis includes factors such as fabric care level, washing intensity and other factors.

This project illustrates key Artificial Intelligence concepts such as:
- Rule-based reasoning  
- Knowledge representation  
- Logical inference using **Prolog*

## ‚ú® Features

- Knowledge base of fabrics, stains, and wash conditions  
- Dynamic rules for fabric care and detergent selection  
- Query-based expert recommendations  
- Easily extensible rule system  
- Educational example of an AI expert system in Prolog

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Language:** SWI-Prolog  
- **Pengines:** Prolog Engines for user interface
- **Concepts:** Facts, Rules, Logical Inference
